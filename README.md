# EJSBlog

Live on - https://blogskj.herokuapp.com/

It's the same as of my previous blog with some updates

1) I have shifted from handlebars to ejs
2) slugify the urls
3) upload of picture on cloudinary server for blog post (earlier it was locally)
4) upload of html so that a stlyed description is rendered on post page
